# GAMLSS
Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). GAMLSS are regression models, where all the parameters (location, scale, and shape) can be modelled as linear, nonlinear or smooth functions of the ex- planatory variables. This is useful because it addresses complexity in the response and explana- tory variable, for example when we see non-linearity or non-parametric smoothing functions are needed. It is also overcomes classic Generative Additive Model limitations like Non-homogeneity of variance or skewness in the distribution
