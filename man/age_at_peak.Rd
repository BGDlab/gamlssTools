\title{Get Age of Peak}
\usage{
age_at_peak(cent_df, peak_from = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cent_df}{dataframe output by \code{centile_predict()}}

\item{peak_from}{optional name of colum in \code{df} that's maximum will define the peak. Otherwise,
defaults to median centile ("cent_0.5")}
}
\value{
dataframe
}
\description{
Find age of peak of median or other specified centile estimates.
}
\details{
Takes output of \code{centile_predict()} or \code{get_derivatives()} and finds age of peak centile
value (or peak change) for each factor level (using lapply). Defaults to finding the
age of the median centile's peak, but can find other specified centiles as well.
